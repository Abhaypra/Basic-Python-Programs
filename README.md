## Introduction

In this repository, I have created a variety of Python projects, including simple games and more complex projects using Object-Oriented Programming. The projects are designed to demonstrate the versatility and power of Python for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Projects

The repository contains two main categories of projects:

1. **Games**: Fun and interactive games written in Python.
2. **OOP Projects**: Projects that demonstrate the use of Object-Oriented Programming in Python.

## Games

Here are some of the games included in this repository:

- **Hangman**: A classic word-guessing game.
- **Caesar Cipher**: A simple encryption program based on the Caesar Cipher technique.
- **Blind Auction**: A program to simulate a blind auction where bids are hidden.
- **High-Low Game**: A number guessing game where the player has to guess whether the next number will be higher or lower.

Each game folder contains:

- The Python script (.py file)


## OOP Projects

These projects showcase the use of Object-Oriented Programming in Python. They include classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and other OOP principles.

Each OOP project folder contains:

- The Python script (.py file)


## Getting Started

To run any of the Python programs in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

For some projects, you might also need Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. You can access these platforms via the following links:

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
